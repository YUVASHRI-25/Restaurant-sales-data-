**📊 Sales Data Analysis**

**📌 About**

This project is based on a dataset Sales-Data-Analysis.csv, which is useful for practicing and applying key data science concepts:

🧹 Data Cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates, formatting text)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (descriptive statistics, patterns, distributions)

📈 Data Visualization (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, etc.)

💰 Sales Insights (best-selling products, revenue trends, customer behavior)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Segmentation (based on Age Groups and Gender — added by me as extra feature engineering)
